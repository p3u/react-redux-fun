# First project for the Modern React with Redux Udemy course

A simple website that fetches videos from youtube api and renders using React.  
No redux involved so far.  


**Interesting take aways:**  
Using arrow functions instead of binding method to the class before passing to child component  

**ES6 sugars syntaxes:**  
	When updating object literal `{video}` instead of `{video:video}`  
	When receiving object as param `({prop})` instead of reading prop from object
	`import React, {Component} from 'react'; Componenet` instead of `import React; React.Component`
